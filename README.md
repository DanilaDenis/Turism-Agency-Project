# Turism-Agency-Project
  My project is a desktop app that handles the booking process of various trips. 
  Upon opening the app, an user(a turism agent) can either log in or register. After that, they have a table view of all available trips, along with their prices, leave times and number of available tickets(if a trip has no more available tickets, it will be highlated with red).
  While logged in, the agent can perform various tasks
    1. Search: they can search for a certain trip, based on name and a time range;
    2. Book trip: they can book a trip in the name of a client;
    3. History: they can view all the bookings they have made;
    4. Log off;
    <h2>to be added</h2>:
        -agents can acces the app in parralel, any change made to trips beeing observable in real time;
        -communication between apps will be possible regardles of programming language used for the app;
